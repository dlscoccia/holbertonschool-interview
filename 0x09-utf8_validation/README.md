# 0x09. UTF-8 Validation

UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding used for electronic communication. Defined by the Unicode Standard, the name is derived from Unicode (or Universal Coded Character Set) Transformation Format â€“ 8-bit.

## Write a method that determines if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

- Prototype: def validUTF8(data)
- Return: True if data is a valid UTF-8 encoding, else return False
- A character in UTF-8 can be 1 to 4 bytes long
- The data set can contain multiple characters
- The data will be represented by a list of integers
- Each integer represents 1 byte of data, therefore you only need to handle the 8 least significant bits of each integer
